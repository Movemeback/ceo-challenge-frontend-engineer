# Frontend Engineer CEO Challenge - GIT4IDEAS

## Your challenge should you choose to accept:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Github for the real-world -  An open source ideas sharing and problem solving platform for Movemeback
Build a prototype platform that allows strangers from across the world to define, ideas, problems and project to collaborate and work on to build solutions - think of it as a modern day github for real-world solutions</td>
  </tr>
</table>


## The Problem

Our lives are often impacted by a multitude of real-world problems of varying complexity that largely remain unsolved. It is often not the complexity or lack of ability that hinders our options for solving  these problems, and more so a lack of awareness, coordination and bringing together of the relevant skill-sets required. With all the talent, skills and knowledge available to the world, it is unforgivable that so many simple problems remain unsolved. This is in stark contrast to the digital world where developers from across the globe who have never met come together to work on open-source projects and create solutions which have gone on to drive multi-billion dollar industries without heavy leadership or financial incentive

## The Solution

Movemeback believes that some of the biggest problems and opportunities across the African Continent (and the world) are highly solvable with very few additional resources than that we possess today. We believe we can make significant step changes in results if we are able to better define our problem statements, organise and access our knowledge, and align and coordinate our efforts and skill-sets globally. 

We believe a lot can be learned from the open source software development community to build platforms that allow strangers with knowledge and skills to convene around common problems of interest and to build transformative solutions to real-world problems.

## The Use Cases

**Use cases**

* Sharing ideas / problem-statements with other individuals of the global online community to raise interest and awareness

* Collaborating with others to develop solutions to defined problems, ideas or projects

* Building private teams of collaborators to deliver solutions

**Example Projects / Ideas**

* Project: Build capabilities to rollout a 5G phone network across African countries

* Idea: Create a new financing system to allow small companies to access loans

* Idea: Create a new political system for African countries

* Problem: How to reduce child deaths from Diarrhea from 2000 a day

* Problem: How to better distribute limited ambulances across countries

## The Requirements

**Sample Project Requirements**

* User must be able to launch a new idea, problem or project

* Users must be able to view ideas, problems or projects and see who has contributed and what they have contributed

* Users should have the option to join a project / idea / problem to contribute

* Users should have multiple means for contribution

* Users should be able to express interest or support in a project without necessarily contributing

* Owners of ideas, problems or projects be able to showcase or invite others to join them with their work

* Ideas, problems and project contributions should be dissectable and organisable into smaller units of work (e.g. branches). 

* Owners of ideas, problems or projects should have some level of control over what contribution groups are merged into the master solutions 

* Owners should be able to showcase or invite others to join them with their work

* Private workspaces should be available allowing owners to have greater control over the visibility, access and contribution permission for work

## The Task

The CEO of Movemeback needs your help to create a design and build a working code prototype of this new feature in 48 hours. It should be a working frontend prototype, however:

* You do not need to implement all requirements, however you should prioritise and try to implement as many as you can to demonstrate your understanding and capabilities

* It does not need to interface with a real backend, you can use dummy data, or even better build a dummy api service

* It does not need to be a fully-completed solution, although there should be enough to allow the CEO to demonstrate it to investors and important users 

* You will need to present your solution, share your vision, discuss your design and technical decisions and justify your choices

* You can request more time if you need - although in business you must always give a good reason and clear timescales for any extension

## Assessment Criteria

1. **Creativity / Innovation**

* How you interpret the problem statement and requirements and how you translate them into a high-level solution

* The uniqueness and innovation 

2. **Independence**

* Are you able to work independently to arrive at a solution with limited information and support

3. **Technical Architecture**

* Is your overall technical solution appropriate for the long-term solution

* Is your solution sophisticated and follow the most effective structure

* Is it scalable, follow best practices and re-usable patterns

4. **Code Quality**

* Does what it should.

* Follows a consistent style.

* Is easy to understand.

* Has been well-documented.

* Can be tested.

5. **Design Quality**

* Is it beautiful to the eye

* Is it user centric and developed with user experience in mind

6. **Communication, Passion & Clarity**

* How well you can describe and communicate your solution

* The clarity you have for your solution what are the next steps
